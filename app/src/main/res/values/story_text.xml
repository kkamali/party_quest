            <item>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked
            you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble
            settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days\' travel southeast of the city.
            Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about
            his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers
            had found "something big" and that he\'d pay you ten gold pieces each
            for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen\'s Provisions, a trading
            post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a
            warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early
            to "take care of business".\n You\'ve spent the last few days following
            the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you\'ve just recently veered east
            along the Triboar Trail. You\'ve encountered no troubles so far, but this
            territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk
            along the trail.</item>

            <item>You\'ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come
            around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead
            of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows
            sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep
            embankment and dense thickets on either side.</item>
